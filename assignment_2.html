        <h1 align="center">Celebrity of cricket</h1>
        <p align="justify">Cricket is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat-and-ball_games">bat-and-ball game</a> played between two teams of eleven players on a 
            <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_field>field</a> at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at 
            each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores 
            runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat (and running between the wickets), 
            while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) 
            and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, 
            when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either 
            catching the ball after it is hit by the bat and before it hits the ground, or hitting a 
            wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten 
            batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated 
            by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. 
            They communicate with two off-field <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_(cricket)">scorers</a> who record the match's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_statistics">statistical information.</a></p>
            <p align="justify">Celebrity is a condition of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fame">fame</a> and broad public recognition of an individual or group, 
                or occasionally a character or animal, as a result of the attention given to them by<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"> mass media. </a>
                 A person may attain a celebrity status from having great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth">wealth</a>, 
                their participation in sports or the entertainment industry, their position 
                as a political figure, or even from their connection to another 
                celebrity. 'Celebrity' usually implies a favorable public image, 
                as opposed to the neutrals 'famous' or 'notable', or the negatives 'infamous' 
                and 'notorious'.</p>
